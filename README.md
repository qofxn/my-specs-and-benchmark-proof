My Current FPS in Games (SCREENSHOTS AND PROOF ABOVE or COMING SOON IF NONE)

*(i lock most my games fps at 160 to keep gpu utilization down and improve 1% lows. i also only have a 144hz monitor so staying constiently over 150 is my main goal of most my optimizations)*

- CS2 : 1280x960 all low video settings reflex & low latency OFF + locked fps at 160 using RTSS = 160fps Consistent in VALVE DM + MODED DM + TDM + PREMIER. *MAX FPS NO CAP:   *

- VALORANT : 1440x1080 all low video settings reflex & low latency ON + locked fps at 160 using NVIDEA Control Pannel = 160fps Consistent in DM + TDM + COMP & exc. *MAX FPS NO CAP:   *

- Call Of Duty Black Ops 7 : 1920x1080 all low settings render res 80% relex ON & low latency OFF + locked fps at 160 using RTSS = 150 - 160 Consistent in SND + 2v2s + FFA VS 12 BOTS with drops to 139 in intense HP and WZ situatuons. *MAX FPS NO CAP:   *
