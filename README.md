# My Current FPS in Games

*(i lock most my games fps at 176 on most games using rtss (exept for valorant i cap at 207 in nivida control panel) to keep gpu utilization down and improve 1% lows. i also only have a 144hz oc'd slightly to 149hz so staying constiently over 155 is my main goal of most my optimizations)*
